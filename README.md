# Customer Personality Analysis

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to understand its customers better and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviours and concerns of different types of customers.
Customer personality analysis helps a business modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.
